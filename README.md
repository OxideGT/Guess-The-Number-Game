1# To play the Guess the Number Game, start by selecting your preferred difficulty level: easy, medium, or hard, each with its own range of possible numbers.

2# Once you've chosen a difficulty, a window will prompt you to guess a number within the specified range.

3# Enter your guess in the provided input field and click the "Submit Guess" button to see if you've correctly guessed the randomly generated number.

4# The game will provide feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct, challenging you to refine your guess until you successfully identify the mystery number.
